Development history

Changes in 10.16

- process_cast.m  GK
  save full mat file information 
  the parameter existed, but it was not implemented

- merge_data.m, default_params.m  GK
  new parameter  params.forced_adcp_ctd_lag
  can be used if the built-in routine does not properly recognize the lag  

- read_sbe_cnv.m  GK
  new variables and handling of special cases

- rdiload.m  default_params.m  GK
  params.timoff_uplooker
  with this one a time offset between up and downlooker can be corrected
  
Changes in 10.15

- get_err.m  GK
  Fixed a problem with the extrapolation of u-ctd. Don't know whether the
  extrapolation was ever necessary, but the way I ensured no interpolation 
  problems was by itself problematic and lead to too high error estimates 
  near the surface. These were very obvious in the error plots (uocean) of
  shallow profiles.

- process_cast.m  GK
  add argument to suppress saving of plots
  this speeds up testing of parameters

- default_params.m  misc_composefilenames.m  rdiload.m  GK
  moved file name and directory composition from default_params.m
  to misc_compose_filenames.m
  moved check for multiple files to rdiload.m
  This fixes a bug where multiple 000 files were only recognized when
  process_cast was run a second time.

- rdiload.m  GK
  changed warning/display of 3-beam solutions   

Changes in 10.14

- calc_depth.m  GK
  fixed bug in surface weights
  thanks to Frederic Marin

- rdiload.m  GK
  changed warning for missing instrument serial number

- xcorr3.m  GK
  added a simple function to calculate the cross correlation
  thanks to Frederic Marin

- edit_data.m  misc_cut_profile.m  nbread.m  getinv.m  calc_sadcp_av.m     GK
  exchanged sind/cosd with sin_d/cos_d
  thanks to Frederic Marin

- plot_result.m
  display instrument serial numbers, if available


Changes in 10.13

- calc_depth.m  GK
  commented and simplified in dinset.m
  fixed bug in calculation of bottom depth when no CTD data is
  available

Changes in 10.12

- default_params.m rdiload.m  GK
  new parameter to force resampling of uplooker to downlooker timing.
  no resampling beyond 10 seconds time difference

- calc_soundsp.m  GK
  small bug that only mattered when up or down needed to be extrapolated

- merge_data.m  24.09.2011  GK
  replaced a nmedian by a meanmediannan as we had jumpy timesteps that
  did not result in a good lag calculation when the lag was very long

- read_sbe_cnv  24.09.2011  GK
  add flag for read_sbe_cnv to disable the setting of data to NaN when
  the pump status is off

- misc_fix_compass.m  29.08.2011  GK
  this function apparently was never used so it contained 
  a number of bugs

- improve.m  29.08.2011  GK
  typo

- read_sbe_cnv.m  25.08.2011  GK
  changed handling of missing c_pri/s_pri 

- calc_rdi_std.m getinv.m  10.06.2011  GK
  new function to 'model' RDI's standard deviation given
  by PlanADCP
  these values are now displayed by getinv.m and should
  compare well with the standard deviation estimated from the data

- whread.m rdiload.m rdihead.m  10.06.2011  GK
  read NB/BB mode from raw data

- prepinv.m getinv.m  10.06.2011  GK
  added second weight matrix plot

- bestlag2.m  02.06.2011  GK
  bug fix for too short data series

- sin_d.m  cos_d.m  31.05.2011  GK
  renamed sind.m and cosd.m as these function now exist in Matlab
  we keep our own for backward compatibility

- figload.m  31.05.2011  GK
  fixed small bug with Matlab versions >7.9

- edit_data.m  31.05.2011  GK
  use a given waterdepth from params.zbottom in PPI calculations

- prepinv.m  29.05.2011  GK
  rewrite of the two-instrument merger rotation part
  should not have changed functionality

- getbtrck.m  28.05.2011  GK
  fixed small inconsistency in comment and action

- process_cast.m, default_params.m  28.05.2011  GK
  added params.print_formats  to default_params.m
  at the moment ps/eps and jpg can be chosen

- edit_data.m, default_params.m  28.05.2011  GK
  added  params.minimum_correlation_threshold  as additional editing parameter
  see  default_params.m  for more explanation

  looks like small bug in tilt_weight application

- besttlag.m  20.05.2011  GK
  renamed to calc_adcp_ctd_lag.m

- rdiload.m  20.05.2011  GK
  replace bestlag.m with bestlag2.m but keep it as check, if correlation
  between up and downlooker is bad

- plot_rawinfo.m  20.05.2011 GK
  add colors to beam performance text

- rdiload.m  14.05.2011 GK
  use error velocity for bestlag calculation preparation

- rdiload.m  
  whread.m  13.05.2011 GK
  read instrument serial number

- plot_result.m  
  default_params.m  12.05.2011 GK
  variable btrk plot range (before limited to 250m)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in 10.11

- switch to magnetic field model IGRF11

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in 10.10

- modified handling of filenames, so that cruise_id is part of the filenames

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in 10.9

- replaced finite in geterr.m & plot_results.m with isfinite
  isfinite exists in >6.1  but finite was removed from 7.9

- whread_multi.m  Pad with NaNs if there are longer gaps between
  the data files

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Changes in 10.8:

- introduced new values for data files. This allows to skip actions 
  if the data are not available
  values.ctdprofdata
  values.ctdtimedata
  values.navdata
  values.sadcpdata

- getbtrack.m  Changed default bottom track range accoding to bin length.

- calc_depth.m , default_parms.m Major changes to recover old functionality
  to calculate  ADCP depth from integrated W and surface and bottom track 
  data. Now also uses build in ADCP pressure sensor with a given 
  weight for the inversion. Changed color of depth plot lines.

- misc_cut_profile.m moved surface and bottom detection to calc_depth.m
  enhanced the plotting capabilitied for shallow casts.

- plot_results.m allow plot of bottom track data for shallower casts.

- calc_ens_av.m changed the way shallow cast get handled to switch to 
  p.avens = 2. Warning for avens = 1 some checks for bad data can not be 
  done and have caused the inversion to fail in some cases.

- replace.m IS WRONG! and causes the read_sbe to crash!!!
  this was fixed    read_sbe_cnv   now calls  nans.m which does the
  same as replace.m but with different arguments

- process_cast(stn) with a negative stn now calls  clear_prep(-stn)

- updated the seawater library to version 3.2 of 19-Apr-2006 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in 10.7:

- startup.m
  moved m directory to last position so that modified
  files can be stored there
  I.e. if one changes a files from m/ladcp, please copy it
  to local m directory and modify there.

- rdiload.m, edit_data.m
  p.maxbinrange has no effect in rdiload anymore
  is moved to edit_data.m

- rdiload.m, default_params.m
  introduced to params.clear_ladcp_pressure
  to clear LADCP pressure records. If there is not CTD
  pressure record, w integration should be used for depth.

- simple_bar.m
  more colors possible

- rdiload.m, default_params.m
  added params.up2down that will control the resampling of the data
  for not synchronous pinging

- figload.m 
  It was noted that colorbars got lost in the fig saving process and
  that paper orientations were not ok. This appeared under versions
  7.4 (possibly others too). The problem was in the saving and loading
  of the fig files. After much browsing of mathworks support site
  I found a variation of the figure loading part that seems to work
  fine. At the moment implemented for >=7.4  but will be tested for
  older versions too.

- process_cast.m
  added several 'drawnow' statements
  since in new Matlab versions the figure was not updated until
  finished with everything

- plot_menu.m
  changed location of plot for OSX so that taskbar does not overlap

- process_cast.m
  Under OSX plots are saved as eps now.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in 10.6:

- rdiload.m
  single ping errors were wrongly calculated when using ensembles
  with more than one ping
  errors were estimated too small by a factor of the number of pings

- besttlag.m
  Fixed warning in cases of NaN in the data. Should not make
  any difference in the result.

- saveres.m
  Added some header info.

- prep*.m
  Changed save commands to use save6.m
  THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED.

- lanarrow.m  process_cast.m
  lanarrow.m converted to function

- bestlag2.m
  bug fix handling data set lengths

- read_sbe_cnv.m 
  nans.m was used in one routine. This should have been 
  replace.m

- prep_ctdprof.m
  was using deprecated field name for nmea_utc_time
